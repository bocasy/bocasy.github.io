For the finishing coat, client requested a galvanize approach, and we consider it a wise idea, as you will see too.</p><p>In the next photos you can see some of our parts, they cover sensors mounts, band tensioners even motor mounts but we did many more.</p><p><a href="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_delphi_general.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_delphi_general.jpeg" alt="Delphi TOL General"/></a> <a href="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_delphi_1.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_delphi_1.jpeg" alt="Delphi TOL 1"/></a> <a href="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_delphi_2.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_delphi_2.jpeg" alt="Delphi TOL 2"/></a> <a href="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_delphi_3.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_delphi_3.jpeg" alt="Delphi TOL 3"/></a> <a href="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_delphi_4.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_delphi_4.jpeg" alt="Delphi TOL 4"/></a></p><h2>Airbag tehnological line</h2><p>In parallel with the above project, we worked for another technologial line, this time for an airbag one. For this one we cover similar parts, but this time we went with a painted finish:</p><p><a href="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_air_1.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_air_1.jpeg" alt="Air TOL 1"/></a> <a href="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_air_2.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_air_2.jpeg" alt="Air TOL 2"/></a></p><p>What is more interesting, for this project, is that we created a mount for a sewing machine, a Juki model. It's a big one that needs to be suspended over the rolling table:</p><p><a href="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_air_3.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-02-06_tol_parts/tol_parts_air_3.jpeg" alt="Air TOL 3"/></a></p><p>Hope you liked what you seen here.

You can see an intermediate step here:</p><p><a href="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/table_before_electric.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/table_before_electric.jpeg" alt="Table Mechanical"/></a></p><p>Once we have a functional system that covers most of the mechanical work we can start linking it to the electrical counterpart.</p><h2>Electrical work</h2><p>Electrical work always starts with buying all the components and waiting for their arrival...</p><p>Here they are:</p><p><a href="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/electric_goods.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/electric_goods.jpeg" alt="Electrical goods"/></a></p><p>We can start our actual work now. Our electrical system will be composed of the following:</p><ol><li>Our brain will be an arduino micro</li><li>One optical sensor for reading the pillow position</li><li>One inductive sensor to read motor that flippes the pillow rotation</li><li>One relay to apply the break on the flipping motor</li><li>One potentiometer</li><li>Two 380v motors with demultiplier</li><li>Fuses</li><li>Control light</li><li>380v commutators</li></ol><h3>First try</h3><p>Yeap, we had a first try that ended in ruins ¯_(ツ)_/¯. But this is always a good oportunity to learn more and expand our knowledge/ So to give you more context we wanted to use an induction senzor, an IFM induction sensor to read motor half turns. This senzor has a 5V-24V and is a two wire one. You can see the senzor and the wireing in the following pictures:</p><p><a href="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/imf_sensor.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/imf_sensor.jpeg" alt="IMF Sensor"/></a> <a href="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/imf_diagram.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/imf_diagram.jpeg" alt="IMF Diagram"/></a></p><p>But for the love of god I wasn't able to make it work with my arduino. Tried different approaches but nothing seemed to work.</p><p>I figured I need to simplify my testing, remove as many components as possible and put a load on the senzor. So I started by putting 24V (went with the automation standard just to be sure) and GND on the senzor made the control led work accordingly. That was a small victory. But once I put some load on it, a standard relay like this:</p><p><a href="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/relay_24v_1.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/relay_24v_1.jpeg" alt="IMF Relay 1"/></a> <a href="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/relay_24v_2.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/relay_24v_2.jpeg" alt="IMF Relay 2"/></a></p><p>The sensor wasn't able to make the relay work so I think it was busted.</p><h3>Right way</h3><p>After my first try I pulled all my electronics out on the table to use all my tools in my toolbox to figure out what the problem wa. I was only able to make a mess of our workstation:</p><p><a href="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/electri_workstation.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/electri_workstation.jpeg" alt="Workbench"/></a></p><p>For the second approach we want with 3-wire sensors and all worked like a charm. This is the final prototype:</p><p><a href="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/prototype_1.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/prototype_1.jpeg" alt="Prototipe Working"/></a> <a href="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/prototype_2.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/prototype_2.jpeg" alt="Prototipe Working"/></a></p><h3>Electric box</h3><p>Once the prototype was finished we could work on the electric box. We wanted to put the brain, fuses, commutators and control lamps and all the wiring. This is the final look of the inside of the electric box:</p><p><a href="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/electric_box_1.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/electric_box_1.jpeg" alt="Electric Box 1"/></a> <a href="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/electric_box_2.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/electric_box_2.jpeg" alt="Electric Box 2"/></a></p><h2>First try</h2><p>With all the electronics in place, I coupled them to the mechanical counterparts and we gave it a shoot:</p><p><a href="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/first_try_1.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/first_try_1.jpeg" alt="First Try 1"/></a> <a href="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/first_try_2.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2021-01-26_flipping_machine/first_try_2.jpeg" alt="First Try 2"/></a></p><p>With a small exception all went acording to plan. A small hiccup that we fixed relatively easy was that the spinning motor was over-spinning. The problem was that I had my arduino work on a slow pace when I did my prototyping. It was as easy as changeing a line and we were back in business.</p><p>Once everything was working we had to unscrew everything so that we can paint all the components.</p><h2>Product presentation</h2><div class="content-iframe-container">

Our client required an upgrade for the pressing plate. The machine was using an old angled iron corner, and we did a custom rod, a diamond shaped one with a specific angle so that the pressing force on carpet was consistent along the rod.</p><p>But we didn't stopped there. We proposed un upgrade to the control system, it was using a pneumatic one that was expensive to do maintenance on it. We proposed to go with an electric one with the brain being an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc">arduino</a>:</p><p><a href="../../images/projects/2020-11-26_carpet_press/carpet_press_electric_2.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2020-11-26_carpet_press/carpet_press_electric_2.jpeg" alt="Electric System"/></a></p><p>Going this new approach will provide a less expensive maintance and a smaller form factor of the control box, and in turn a smaller table. We even improved it, client can manually adjust the pressing time, in case you want to cover a large varaiety of carpet models. You can see here the final look of the control box:</p><p><a href="../../images/projects/2020-11-26_carpet_press/carpet_press_electric_1.jpeg"> <img src="../../images/projects/2020-11-26_carpet_press/carpet_press_electric_1.jpeg" alt="Electric System 1"/></a></p><h2>Product presentation</h2><p>We are very pleased with our final product, but that is not the most important thing, we were curiose what our client had to say about it.

Main requirement was to make it configurable. To achieve this we made it as a rotating table, similar with a CNC head, in which you can replace each slot with required head. Another fact that had to take in account was that the press had to also preforate the material before actually applying the eyelet.</p><p>We ended up with a great design that was inline with our customer requirements.</p><h2>Head configuration</h2><p>You can see in product presentation the configurability we talked about.
